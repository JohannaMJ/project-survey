# Survey form with React

Plant survey app/website created in React, using components and state. The results from the survey are displayed in an overview in the end of the survey.

## The problem

The app is created in React and its different parts are divided into components. I started off creating state objects for the different questions in order to store property values and re-render the components when the objects are changes. Each question has its own component, as well as the overview and welcome page. By using if-else logic the different questions are displayed after each other.
I added alert messages so that all questions must be answered before moving on in the survey, and later on I changed so that there is a message shown in the app instead of an alert. The app also has a counter that informs the user which question is being answered and how many are left.

If I had more time I would like different questions to appear depending on the answer on previous questions.
